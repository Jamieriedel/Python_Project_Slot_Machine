## Gameplay ##

### Deposit: ### 
At the start of the game, players are prompted to deposit money into their balance. They can enter the amount they wish to deposit, which should be a positive integer.

### Place Bet: ###
Players can choose the number of lines to bet on and the amount of money they want to bet per line. The maximum bet amount is set by MAX_BET, and the minimum bet amount is set by MIN_BET.

### Spin the Wheels: ###
After placing their bets, players can spin the slot machine reels. The reels consist of a grid of symbols, and each spin generates a random arrangement of symbols.

### Winning: ###
Players win money based on the combination of symbols that appear on the reels. The winning combinations are determined by the symbol_count and symbol_value dictionaries.

### Continue Playing: ###
